Public code sample of basic XQA (eXtreme Quality Assurance), which has been used to stabilise huge fragile-agile projects. Please visit http://montanamedialab.com/ for additional XQA resources.

The sample code is simple Java, which tells the time in an informal manner as would be used in conversational English.

For example:

00:00 is "midnight"
00:01 is "just after midnight"
00:05 is "five past midnight"
00:07 is "just after five past midnight"

The sample code is based on real-world examples of similar utility code, and also demonstrates a number of  Object Oriented design patterns, without overkill. The code is supported by junit tests, code coverage to validate reach of the unit tests, and a number of Open Source staic analysis scans to verify code correctness. 


Ant build
=========
Please review the Ant build file for all possible targets. Typical use cases:


$ ant -f  build-montana-xqa.xml clean
Removes built artifacts


$ ant -f  build-montana-xqa.xml build
Compiles project into ./bin


$ ant -f  build-montana-xqa.xml all-tests
Runs unit tests, and code-coverage to validate test thoroughness. Results stored in ./junit, ./code-coverage


$ ant -f  build-montana-xqa.xml static-analysis
Determine code-correctness using OSS tooling, specifically PMD, CheckStyle, FindBugs. Results stored in ./static-analysis
